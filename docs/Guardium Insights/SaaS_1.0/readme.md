# Guardium Insights SaaS 1.0
The universal connector uses plug-ins to connect to the datasource server.

There are a number of [available plugins](../../docs/available_plugins.md) that can connect various data sources to Guardium Insights.

Please refer to [Managing plug-ins](../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/SaaS_1.0/Plugins_management.md) to make sure the required plug-in is installed before configuring a new universal connector.

Once the plug-in is installed, you can [create a new connection](../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/SaaS_1.0/UC_Configuration_GI.md). 

The connection initialization can take few minutes. To monitor the current status of connection and the latest traffic, click [here](../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/SaaS_1.0/monitoring_GI.MD).
