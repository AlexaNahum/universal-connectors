# Guardium Data Protection 11.5

The universal connector uses plug-ins to connect to the datasource server.

There are a number of [available plugins](../docs/available_plugins.md) that can connect various data sources to Guardium Data Protection.

In cases where the requested data source isn't available, please refer to [Developing a plug-in](../docs/Guardium%20Data%20Protection/developing_plugins_gdp.md).

Once the plug-in is installed, you can [create a new connection](../docs/Guardium%20Data%20Protection/uc_config_gdp.md). 

The connection initialization can take few minutes. To monitor the current status of connection and the latest traffic, click [here](../docs/Guardium%20Data%20Protection/monitoring_GDP.md).
